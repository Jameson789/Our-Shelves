## Useful Commands

```bash
# Restart all processes
pm2 restart all

# View logs
pm2 logs

# Clear old logs
pm2 flush

pm2 stop all

# Delete processes
pm2 delete all
```

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Ensure `.env` files are correctly configured in both `frontend` and `backend`.
- Confirm MySQL credentials match your `.env`.
- Use `pm2 flush` to clear old logs when fixing errors.
- Check firewall settings if deploying to a remote server (allow ports 3000 and 5173).
